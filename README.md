## Prerequisites

Before running the server, make sure you have the following software installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version X.X.X or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes bundled with Node.js)

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
   ```

2. Change into the project's directory:

   ```bash
   cd project-name
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a new file called `.env` in the project's root directory.

5. Open the `.env` file and add the following line, replacing `YOUR_MONGO_URL` with your own MongoDB connection URL:

   ```
   MONGO_URL=YOUR_MONGO_URL
   ```

   Save the file after making the changes.

## Running the Server

To start the server, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the server and make it accessible at `http://localhost:3001`. You should see a message in the console indicating that the server is running.
